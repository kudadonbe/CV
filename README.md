# CV Repository

Welcome to the CV Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for managing and storing curriculum vitae (CVs). While it currently focuses on organizing and maintaining CV documents, this repository is part of a larger project. In the future, I plan to develop an app specifically designed to create, manage, and customize CVs efficiently.

## Repository Structure

At present, the repository does not contain predefined subfolders, but these will be created in the future as the project evolves. The planned structure includes:

- **/cv**: A directory for storing all CV files. Future subfolders may include categories like:
  - **/job_applications**: For job-specific CVs.
  - **/academic**: For CVs tailored to academic positions.
  - **/general**: For general-purpose CVs.

- **/templates**: A directory for CV templates that can be reused to maintain consistency across documents.

- **/resources**: A directory for additional materials that complement CVs, such as cover letters and references.

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository and its intended structure.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cv-repo.git
   ```

2. **Organize Your CVs**: As the project progresses, you'll be able to add your CVs to specific subfolders within the `/cv` directory. For now, you can simply store them in the root directory or create your own folder structure.

3. **Use Templates**: Templates will be added in the `/templates` directory in the future. These will help you create new CVs with consistent formatting and structure.

4. **Track Changes**: Use Git to commit changes regularly, maintaining a history of revisions. This will be crucial as the project expands into a full-fledged CV management app.

## Future Development

This repository is the groundwork for a future projectâ€”a comprehensive app designed to create, manage, and customize CVs. Planned features include:

- **Automated CV Generation**: Quickly generate CVs from templates.
- **Version Control**: Easily track and manage different versions of your CVs.
- **Customization Options**: Tailor your CV for specific job applications or academic roles.
